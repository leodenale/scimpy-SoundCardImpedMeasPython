and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). This
project defines the API as the set of high-level functions performed by the

TS fitting of speaker data, and modeling of speaker performance using TS
parameters. Any adition to removal of high-level capabilities would be a change
to the API.
